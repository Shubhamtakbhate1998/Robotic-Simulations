I have used MATLAB as a software.
Those who want test can copy paste this and remember that save the functions name accordingly.
New task has diffrent cube configuration x=1,y=0 intially & x=1,y=-1.5 you can test this secene in simulator with this config
I have added videoes for milestone one and code for milestone 1 just to show that I have done this task progrssively.
I was able to write indivisual codes but while looping over N-1 i relised that I have to make changes to them. For example for enterring angles in Fkinbody we need row vector. But at first I couldnt do it with original code. Later I did it.
I have made overshoot and best case accordingly.
Also implementing feedforward only does not find any solutions. I have uploaded the video for the same. 
Differnt error plots are in respective folder.
an error file is also present in the new task.
Now I would like to no about self collision so please hint me in the comment.
